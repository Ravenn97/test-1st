She tried being reclusive. She tried leaving the country, and she tried finding a job. But the epic humiliation of 1998, when her affair with Bill Clinton became an all-consuming story, has followed Monica Lewinsky every day. After 10 years of self-imposed reticence, and now hoping to help victims of Internet shaming, she critiques the culture that put a 24-year-old through the wringer and calls out the feminists who joined the chorus.by Monica LewinskyPhotographs by Mark SeligerJune 2014EmailFacebookTwitterLYING LOW The author, who has kept out of the public eye for a decade, photographed at her Los Angeles apartment.Photograph by Mark Seliger.‘How does it feel to be America’s premier blow-job queen?”It was early 2001. I was sitting on the stage of New York’s Cooper Union in the middle of taping a Q&A for an HBO documentary. I was the subject. And I was thunderstruck.Hundreds of people in the audience, mostly students, were staring at me, many with their mouths agape, wondering if I would dare to answer this question.The main reason I had agreed to participate in the program was not to rehash or revise the story line of Interngate but to try to shift the focus to meaningful issues. Many troubling political and judicial questions had been brought to light by the investigation and impeachment of President Bill Clinton. But the most egregious had been generally ignored. People seemed indifferent to the deeper matters at hand, such as the erosion of private life in the public sphere, the balance of power and gender inequality in politics and media, and the erosion of legal protections to ensure that neither a parent nor a child should ever have to testify against each other.How naïve I was.There were gasps and sputters from the audience. Numerous blurred, faceless people called out, “Don’t answer it!”“It’s hurtful and it’s insulting,” I said, attempting to gather my wits. “And as insulting as it is to me, it’s even more insulting to my family. I don’t actually know why this whole story became about oral sex. I don’t. It was a mutual relationship.… The fact that it did is maybe a result of a male-dominated society.”The audience laughed. Maybe they were surprised to hear these words coming from me.I looked straight at the smirking guy who had asked the question. “You might be better poised to answer that.” After a pause, I added, “That’s probably cost me another year of therapy.”You could argue that in agreeing to participate in an HBO documentary called Monica in Black and White I had signed up to be shamed and publicly humiliated yet again. You might even think I would have been inured to humiliation. This encounter at Cooper Union, after all, paled in comparison with the 445-page Starr Report, which was the culmination of independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s four-year investigation of the Clinton White House. It included chapter and verse about my intimate sexual activities, along with transcripts of audiotapes that chronicled many of my private conversations. But the “B.J. Queen” question—which was included in the show when it aired on HBO in 2002—sat with me for a long time after the audience left and the taping wrapped.True, this wasn’t the first time I’d been stigmatized for my affair with Bill Clinton. But never had I been so directly confronted, one-on-one, with such a crass characterization. One of the unintended consequences of my agreeing to put myself out there and to try to tell the truth had been that shame would once again be hung around my neck like a scarlet-A albatross. Believe me, once it’s on, it is a bitch to take off.Had that awkward moment at Cooper Union aired only a few years later, with the advent of social media, the humiliation would have been even more devastating. That clip would have gone viral on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, TMZ, Gawker. It would have become a meme of its own on Tumblr. The viralness itself would have merited mention on the Daily Beast and Huffington Post. As it was, it was viral enough, and, thanks to the all-encompassing nature of the Web, you can, 12 years later, watch it all day long on YouTube if you want to (but I really hope you have better things to do with your time).I know I’m not alone when it comes to public humiliation. No one, it seems, can escape the unforgiving gaze of the Internet, where gossip, half-truths, and lies take root and fester. We have created, to borrow a term from historian Nicolaus Mills, a “culture of humiliation” that not only encourages and revels in Schadenfreude but also rewards those who humiliate others, from the ranks of the paparazzi to the gossip bloggers, the late-night comedians, and the Web “entrepreneurs” who profit from clandestine videos.Yes, we’re all connected now. We can tweet a revolution in the streets or chronicle achievements large and small. But we’re also caught in a feedback loop of defame and shame, one in which we have become both perps and victims. We may not have become a crueler society—although it sure feels as if we have—but the Internet has seismically shifted the tone of our interactions. The ease, the speed, and the distance that our electronic devices afford us can also make us colder, more glib, and less concerned about the consequences of our pranks and prejudice. Having lived humiliation in the most intimate possible way, I marvel at how willingly we have all signed on to this new way of being.In my own case, each easy click of that YouTube link reinforces the archetype, despite my efforts to parry it away: Me, America’s B.J. Queen. That Intern. That Vixen. Or, in the inescapable phrase of our 42nd president, “That Woman.”It may surprise you to learn that I’m actually a person.In 1998, when news of my affair with Bill Clinton broke, I was arguably the most humiliated person in the world. Thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the Internet.For several years I tried my hand in the fashion-accessory business and became involved in various media projects, including the HBO documentary. Then I lay low for the most part. (The last major interview I granted was 10 years ago.) After all, not lying low had exposed me to criticism for trying to “capitalize” on my “notoriety.” Apparently, others talking about me is O.K.; me speaking out for myself is not. I turned down offers that would have earned me more than $10 million, because they didn’t feel like the right thing to do. Over time, the media circus quieted down, but it never quite moved on, even as I attempted to move on.Meanwhile, I watched my friends’ lives move forward. Marriages. Kids. Degrees. (Second marriages. More kids. More degrees.) I decided to turn over a new leaf and attend grad school.I moved to England to study, to challenge myself, to escape scrutiny, and to reimagine my identity. My professors and fellow students at the London School of Economics were wonderful—welcoming and respectful. I had more anonymity in London, perhaps due to the fact that I spent most of my waking hours in class or buried in the library. In 2006, I graduated with a master’s in social psychology. My master’s thesis examined social bias in the courtroom and was titled “In Search of the Impartial Juror: An Exploration of Pretrial Publicity and the Third Person Effect.” I liked to joke that I was trading the blue dress for blue stockings, and the degree provided new scaffolding to hang my life experiences on. It would also prove, so I hoped, to be a gateway to a more normal life.I moved between London, Los Angeles, New York, and Portland, Oregon, interviewing for a variety of jobs that fell under the umbrella of “creative communication” and “branding,” with an emphasis on charity campaigns. Yet, because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my “history,” I was never “quite right” for the position. In some cases, I was right for all the wrong reasons, as in “Of course, your job would require you to attend our events.” And, of course, these would be events at which press would be in attendance.In one promising job interview that took place during the run-up to the 2008 primary season, the conversation took an interesting turn. “So here’s the thing, Monica,” the interviewer said. “You’re clearly a bright young woman and affable, but for us—and probably any other organization that relies on grants and other government funding—it’s risky. We would first need a Letter of Indemnification from the Clintons. After all, there is a 25 percent chance that Mrs. Clinton will be the next president.” I gave a fake smile and said, “I understand.”Another job interview, this one typical: walked into the stark, terminally cool reception area of a hip-yet-prestigious advertising agency in Los Angeles, my hometown. As always, I put on my best “I’m friendly, not a diva” smile. “Hi. Monica Lewinsky here to see So-and-So.”The twentysomething receptionist pushed her black-rimmed hipster frames up her nose. “Monica who?”Before I could answer, another twentysomething, in skinny jeans, plaid shirt, and bow tie, rushed over and interrupted: “ Ms. Lewinsky.” Like a maître d’, he continued, “Pleasure to have you here. I’ll let So-and-So know you’ve arrived. Soy latte? Green tea? Filtered water?”I found myself sitting at a small round table, face-to-face with So-and-So, the agency’s head of strategy and planning. We talked. She kept wincing. This was not going well. I tried to keep myself from getting flustered. Now she was not only wincing but also clearing her throat. Was that perspiration on her brow? It hit me: she was nervous, in full-tic mode.I’ve had to become adept at handling any number of reactions in social situations and job interviews. I get it: it must be disconcerting to sit across from “That Woman.” Needless to say, I didn’t get the position.I eventually came to realize that traditional employment might not be an option for me. I’ve managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects, usually with start-ups that I have participated in, or with loans from friends and family.In another job interview I was asked, “If you were a brand, which brand would you be?” Let me tell you, when you’re Monica Lewinsky, that is one loaded question.In September of 2010, the culmination of these experiences began to snap into a broader context for me. A phone conversation with my mother shifted the lens through which I viewed my world. We were discussing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi. Tyler, you will recall, was an 18-year-old Rutgers freshman who was secretly streamed via Webcam kissing another man. Days later, after being derided and humiliated on social media, he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge.My mom wept. Sobbing, she kept repeating over and over, “How his parents must feel … his poor parents.”It was an unbearably tragic event, and while hearing of it brought me to tears, too, I couldn’t quite grasp why my mom was so distraught. And then it dawned on me: she was reliving 1998, when she wouldn’t let me out of her sight. She was replaying those weeks when she stayed by my bed, night after night, because I, too, was suicidal. The shame, the scorn, and the fear that had been thrown at her daughter left her afraid that I would take my own life—a fear that I would be literally humiliated to death. (I have never actually attempted suicide, but I had strong suicidal temptations several times during the investigations and during one or two periods after.)I would never be so presumptuous as to equate my own story with Tyler Clementi’s. After all, my public humiliation had been the result of my involvement with a world-renowned public figure—that is, a consequence of my own poor choices. But in that moment, when I felt the depths of my mother’s anguish, I wished I could have had a chance to have spoken to Tyler about how my love life, my sex life, my most private moments, my most sensitive secrets, had been broadcast around the globe. I wished I had been able to say to him that I knew a little of how it might have felt for him to be exposed before the world. And, as hard as it is to imagine surviving it, it is possible.In the wake of Tyler’s tragedy, my own suffering took on a different meaning. Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past? It was my Prufrockian moment: “Do I dare / Disturb the universe?” Or, in my case, the Clinton universe.Despite a decade of self-imposed silence, I have been periodically resuscitated as part of the national conversation, almost always in connection with the Clintons. For instance, in January and February of this year, Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator and a possible 2016 Republican presidential aspirant, managed to drag me into the pre-election muck. He fought back against the Democrats’ charges of a G.O.P. “war on women” by arguing that Bill Clinton had committed workplace “violence” and acted in a “predatory” manner against “a 20-year-old girl who was there from college.”Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any “abuse” came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.So, trying to disappear has not kept me out of the fray. I am, for better or for worse, presumed to be a known quantity. Every day I am recognized. Every day. Sometimes a person will walk past me again and again, as if I wouldn’t notice. (Thankfully, 99.9 percent of the time when strangers do say something to me they are supportive and respectful.) Every day someone mentions me in a tweet or a blog post, and not altogether kindly. Every day, it seems, my name shows up in an op-ed column or a press clip or two—mentioned in passing in articles on subjects as disparate as millennials, Scandal, and French president François Hollande’s love life. Miley Cyrus references me in her twerking stage act, Eminem raps about me, and Beyoncé’s latest hit gives me a shout-out. Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we’re verbing, I think you meant “Bill Clinton’d all on my gown,” not “Monica Lewinsky’d.”With every man I date (yes, I date!), I go through some degree of 1998 whiplash. I need to be extremely circumspect about what it means to be “public” with someone. In the early years post-impeachment, I once left a front-row seat along the third-base line at a Yankees game when I learned that my date—a guy whose company I thoroughly enjoyed—was actually in another relationship. It was only a green-card marriage, but I freaked that we could be photographed together and someone might call the gossip rags. I’ve become adept at figuring out when men are interested in me for the wrong reason. Thankfully, those have been few and far between. But every man that has been special to me over the past 16 years has helped me find another piece of myself—the self that was shattered in 1998. And so, no matter the heartbreak, tears, or disenchantment, I’ll always be grateful to them.In February of this year, around the same time Senator Paul put me back into the unwanted spotlight, I became the “narcissistic loony toon,” the latest twist on Me as Archetype.A snapshot of a scenario I’ve grown all too accustomed to, even as I attempt to move on with my life: A shrill ring interrupts the rhythms of my day. The call—from the doorman of the apartment building where I’m staying in New York—leads me to an exasperated “What? Again?” They’ve reappeared: the paparazzi, like swallows, have returned to the sidewalk outside, pacing and circling and pacing some more.I hit the computer. Time for a little self-Google. (Oh, dear reader, please do not judge.) My heart sinks. There’s an explosion on Google News. I know what this means. Whatever day I’ve planned has been jettisoned. To leave the house—and risk a photo—only ensures that the story will stay alive.The cameras have returned because of the headlines: a conservative Web site has gone poking around the University of Arkansas archive of one of Hillary Clinton’s closest friends and admirers, Diane Blair, and has unearthed a cache of memos from the 1990s. In some of them, Blair, who died in 2000, quotes the former First Lady about her husband’s relationship with me. Though Hillary, according to Blair’s notes, claimed to find her husband’s “lapse” inexcusable, she praised him for trying to “manage someone who was clearly a ‘narcissistic loony toon.’ ”My first thought, as I was getting up to speed: If that’s the worst thing she said, I should be so lucky. Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband’s affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him. Although she regarded Bill as having engaged in “gross inappropriate behavior,” the affair was, nonetheless, “consensual (was not a power relationship).”I field the usual calls from friends who lend moral support whenever these volcanic media stories erupt. They diffuse the tension with good-natured teasing: “So, are we changing your monogram to NLT?” I try to ignore the former First Lady’s long-buried comments. Given my experiences with Linda Tripp, I know better than anyone what it’s like to have a conversation with a girlfriend exposed and scrutinized, taken out of context. But, even so, it begins to gnaw at me. I realize that Hillary Clinton was—unlike me when Tripp was prying loose my innermost secrets and insecurities and recording them surreptitiously—fully aware of this documentation: she’s the one who, according to the memos, asked Blair to keep a record or diary of their discussions for archival purposes.Yes, I get it. Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband’s mistress. She may have faulted her husband for being inappropriate, but I find her impulse to blame the Woman—not only me, but herself—troubling. And all too familiar: with every marital indiscretion that finds its way into the public sphere—many of which involve male politicians—it always seems like the woman conveniently takes the fall. Sure, the Anthony Weiners and Eliot Spitzers do what they need to do to look humiliated on cable news. They bow out of public life for a while, but they inevitably return, having put it all behind them. The women in these imbroglios return to lives that are not so easily repaired.But there is another layer here that is making me bristle: Narcissist? Loony?You might remember that just five days before the world had ever heard my name the F.B.I.—after my friend Linda Tripp approached Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr’s office with information about my affair with the president—entrapped me in a terrifying “sting” in the Pentagon City mall. At age 24, cornered in a hotel room on January 16, 1998, with mainly male interrogators taking orders from Starr, I was discouraged from contacting my attorney and threatened with 27 years in jail for filing an affidavit denying the affair with Clinton, among other alleged crimes. I was offered immunity from that threat if I agreed to place monitored calls and wear a wire in conversations with two of the president’s confidants and possibly the president himself. I refused. Confiding in Linda Tripp turned into an unintended betrayal. But this? The mother of all betrayals. That, I couldn’t do. Courageous or foolish, maybe, but narcissistic and loony?These 16-year-old descriptions of me triggered memories of past anguish, particularly in the area of women lobbing derision at one another. So where, you might be wondering, were the feminists back then?It’s a question that troubles me to this day.I sorely wished for some sign of understanding from the feminist camp. Some good, old-fashioned, girl-on-girl support was much in need. None came. Given the issues at play—gender politics, sex in the workplace—you’d think they would have spoken up. They didn’t. I understood their dilemma: Bill Clinton had been a president “friendly” to women’s causes.It also didn’t help that my case was not one of conventional “sexual harassment”; that charge against Bill Clinton had been made by Paula Jones, who brought a colossal lawsuit against him. My name surfaced only because, thanks to newly won advances by feminists, investigations of such cases were now allowed to cast a wider net. The Jones case became a stick that the right wing used to strike back at the Clinton-supporting feminists: Why wouldn’t they enthusiastically support an investigation into a case of sexual harassment? What if the president had been a Republican? Charges of hypocrisy flew.A handful of representatives of the modern feminist movement did chime in, obliquely. Yet, instead of any meaningful engagement, we got this: January 30, 1998. Day Nine of the scandal. Cocktails at Le Bernardin, in Manhattan. In attendance: writers Erica Jong, Nancy Friday, Katie Roiphe, and Elizabeth Benedict; Saturday Night Live writer Patricia Marx; Marisa Bowe, the editor of Word, an online magazine; fashion designer Nicole Miller; former dominatrix Susan Shellogg; and their host, Le Bernardin co-owner Maguy Le Coze. The New York Observer brought this coven together to trade Interngate insights, to be recorded by Francine Prose. (Sadly, the gal who would really make this coven complete is missing: Maureen Dowd, or Moremean Dowdy, as I used to refer to her. Today, I’d meet her for a drink.)Oh, to have been at that cocktail party:Marisa Bowe: His whole life is about having to be in control and really intelligent all the time. And his wife is really intelligent and in control all the time. And the idea of just having stupid sex with some not-brilliant woman in the Oval Office, I can see the appeal in that.Imaginary Me: I’m not saying I’m brilliant, but how do you know I’m not? My first job out of college was at the White House.Susan Shellogg: And do you think it’s tremendously selfish? Selfish and demanding, having oral sex and not reciprocating? I mean … she didn’t say, “Well, you know he satisfied me.”Me: And where exactly “didn’t” I say this? In which public statement that I didn’t make? In which testimony that’s not been released?Katie Roiphe: I think what people are outraged about is the way that [Monica Lewinsky] looks, which is interesting. Because we like to think of our presidents as sort of godlike, and so if J.F.K. has an affair with Marilyn Monroe, it’s all in the realm of the demigods…. I mean, the thing I kept hearing over and over again was Monica Lewinsky’s not that pretty.Me: Well, thanks. The first picture that surfaced was a passport photo. Would you like to have a passport photo splattered across publications around the world as the picture that defines you?What you are also saying here is that the primary quality that would qualify a woman to have an intimate relationship with a powerful man is physical attractiveness. If that’s not setting the movement back, I don’t know what is.Erica Jong: My dental hygienist pointed out that she had third-stage gum disease.Shellogg: What do you think will happen to [her]? I mean, she’ll just fade out quietly or write a book? Or people will forget about her six months from now?Nancy Friday: She can rent out her mouth.Me: (Speechless.)Jong: But, you know, men do like to get close to the mouth that has been close to power. Think of the fantasy in the man’s mind as she’s going down on him and he’s thinking, “Oh my God.”Elizabeth Benedict: Do for me what you did to the President. Do that.Me: (Still speechless.)Jong: I think it’s a tribute to how far we’ve come that we’re not trashing Monica Lewinsky.The catty confab appeared under the headline SUPERGALS LOVE THAT NAUGHTY PREZ. (Writing in Vanity Fair, Marjorie Williams called it “the most embarrassing thing I had read in a long time.”) To me, it illustrates a perplexing aspect of the culture of humiliation, one that Phyllis Chesler recognized in her book Woman’s Inhumanity to Woman: that women themselves are not immune to certain kinds of misogyny. We see it today in how the “mean girls” at school lurk on the modern playground of the Web (or around a pundit’s roundtable on TV or at a French restaurant), ever eager to pile on.I still have deep respect for feminism and am thankful for the great strides the movement has made in advancing women’s rights over the past few decades. But, given my experience of being passed around like gender-politics cocktail food, I don’t identify myself as a Feminist, capital F. The movement’s leaders failed in articulating a position that was not essentially anti-woman during the witch hunt of 1998. In the case of the New York Supergals, it should not have been that hard for them to swoon over the president without attacking and shaming me. Instead, they joined the humiliation derby.I , myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened. At the time—at least from my point of view—it was an authentic connection, with emotional intimacy, frequent visits, plans made, phone calls and gifts exchanged. In my early 20s, I was too young to understand the real-life consequences, and too young to see that I would be sacrificed for political expediency. I look back now, shake my head in disbelief, and wonder: what was I—what were we—thinking? I would give anything to go back and rewind the tape.Like many other Americans, I’ve been thinking about Hillary Clinton. What might happen, I’ve wondered, if she does run in 2016? And what if she wins—and then wins a second term?But when I think about these matters, there’s a dimension at play for me other than just the fact that we might finally have a woman in the White House. We all remember the second-wave feminist rallying cry The personal is political. Many people (myself included) proclaimed that my relationship with Bill Clinton was a personal matter, not one to be used in a high-stakes political war. When I hear of Hillary’s prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of “Where is she now?” stories, the next reference to me in Fox News’s coverage of the primaries. I’ve begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life based, to some degree, on the political calendar. For me, it’s a scenario in which the personal and the political are impossible to separate.In 2008, when Hillary was running for president, I remained virtually reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests. I put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election. (They were subsequently canceled—and, no, I wasn’t offered $12 million for a salacious tell-all book, contrary to press reports.) And recently I’ve found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of “becoming an issue” should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years?Being a conscientious Democrat—and aware that I could be used as a tool for the left or the right—I have remained silent for 10 years. So silent, in fact, that the buzz in some circles has been that the Clintons must have paid me off; why else would I have refrained from speaking out? I can assure you that nothing could be further from the truth.So why speak now? Because it is time.I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past—and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I’ve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.) Despite what some headlines will falsely report about this piece, this is not about Me versus the Clintons. Their lives have moved on; they occupy important and powerful places on the global stage. I wish them no ill. And I fully understand that what has happened to me and the issue of my future do not matter to either of them.It also goes back to the personal and the political. I have lived many of the questions that have become central to our national discourse since 1998. How far should we allow the government into our bedrooms? How do we reconcile the right to privacy with the need to expose sexual indiscretion? How do we guard against an overzealous government demanding our private data and information? And, most important to me personally, how do we cope with the shame game as it’s played in the Internet Age? (My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.)So far, That Woman has never been able to escape the shadow of that first depiction. I was the Unstable Stalker (a phrase disseminated by the Clinton White House), the Dimwit Floozy, the Poor Innocent who didn’t know any better. The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power. I became a social representation, a social canvas on which anybody could project their confusion about women, sex, infidelity, politics, and body issues.Unlike the other parties involved, I was so young that I had no established identity to which I could return. I didn’t “let this define” me—I simply hadn’t had the life experience to establish my own identity in 1998. If you haven’t figured out who you are, it’s hard not to accept the horrible image of you created by others. (Thus, my compassion for young people who find themselves shamed on the Web.)

Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband&#x2019;s mistress. She may have faulted her husband for being inappropriate, but I find her impulse to blame the Woman&#x2014;not only me, but herself&#x2014;troubling. And all too familiar: with every marital indiscretion that finds its way into the public sphere&#x2014;many of which involve male politicians&#x2014;it always seems like the woman conveniently takes the fall. Sure, the Anthony Weiners and Eliot Spitzers do what they need to do to look humiliated on cable news. They bow out of public life for a while, but they inevitably return, having put it all behind them.

At age 24, cornered in a hotel room on January 16, 1998, with mainly male interrogators taking orders from Starr, I was discouraged from contacting my attorney and threatened with 27 years in jail for filing an affidavit denying the affair with Clinton, among other alleged crimes. I was offered immunity from that threat if I agreed to place monitored calls and wear a wire in conversations with two of the president&#x2019;s confidants and possibly the president himself. I refused. Confiding in Linda Tripp turned into an unintended betrayal. But this? The mother of all betrayals. That, I couldn&#x2019;t do.

He did, in a grip famously caught by a photographer. Afterwards, Clinton is said to have turned around and told his pals that someday, he would have that job.\n<p>As president, Clinton turned around the American economy, which was starting to snap back from a recession, and managed to become the most recent commander-in-chief to balance a budget. He created more than 22 million jobs, and poverty levels tumbled along with the unemployment rate. He signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Brady Bill into law. But his presidency was hardly free of controversy. Clinton was dogged by scandals throughout his time in the White House&#8212;many of them the creation of his political enemies, while others turned out to be all too true. In 1998, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his testimony about his affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky.

Others <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/961377587070210049\">saw the speech</a> as a shrewd bit of politicking designed to soften the blow of a budget deal that, again, overlooks Dreamers; with Pelosi on the floor, her aides were part of a team <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2018/02/08/government-shutdown-deadline-is-tonight-heres-what-today-looks-like-bade-and-bresnahan-on-duncan-hunter-tracking-who-knew-what-when-about-rob-porter-245484\">reportedly</a> “lightly encouraging a yes vote” on the spending bill. “The reality,” a moderate Democratic aide <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heatherscope/status/961317658158338049\">observed</a> “is that the filibuster is only being done to cater to the left-wing of the party at the expense of the larger caucus, and it’s in the interest of one person: Leader Pelosi.”</p>\n<p>Though Pelosi had her supporters&#8212;Rep. <strong>Tim Ryan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/07/nancy-pelosi-dreamers-democrats-398166\">called</a> the action “entirely appropriate”&#8212;the wave of discontent is emblematic of a deeper scheme within the party to eventually unseat her. The 2016 primary revealed deep rifts between an ossified Democratic elite and an increasingly progressive base, but the coalition has so far stuck together, running hopeful races based on anti-Trump sentiment. Should Dems fail to ride the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/dnc-midterms-fundraising-shortfall\">“blue wave”</a> to victory, however, they’re girding for what Rep. <strong>Alcee Hastings</strong> described as an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/06/nancy-pelosi-house-democrats-395924\">“intraparty war”</a>. On one side: Pelosi allies, represented by Minority Whip <strong>Steny Hoyer</strong>; on the other, younger Democrats, led by Democratic Caucus Chairman <strong>Joe Crowley</strong> (though several other names are in the mix). As one House Democrat told Politico, the impetus for a fissure runs deeper than loyalties: “Most of us are ready for a real change and new leadership . . .The issue is not even about personalities. It’s about the future versus the past.”</p>\n<p>Republicans, too, are fueling concerns as they seize on characterizations of Pelosi as a hectoring, contrarian, progressive woman, a role once filled by <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong> “The longer @NancyPelosi bloviates on the House Floor against the deal&#8212;the more I’m inclined to support it,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepMarkWalker/status/961333318741524481\">tweeted Republican Congressman <strong>Mark Walker</strong></a>, who had expressed reservations toward the initial budget deal, while two other Republicans <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/961364452871430145\">told Politico’s <strong>Jake Sherman</strong></a> that they thought her speech would <em>help</em> them rally votes for their version of the bill.</p>\n<p>By taking a stand, it seems, Pelosi had fallen into the Republican trap, cementing her status as their electoral foil. With a contentious midterm looming on the horizon, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/republicans-want-make-2018-all-about-nancy-pelosi-are-democrats-n845436\">NBC News reports</a> that Republicans and their allied groups have prepared a barrage of anti-Pelosi ads to run in states facing close House races. The National Republican Congressional Committee is currently testing this message against <strong>Conor Lamb,</strong> the Democratic candidate running in the upcoming Pennsylvania special election: “Nancy Pelosi is calling your tax cuts ‘crumbs’ and ‘pathetic.’ Conor Lamb sounds just like her.” (Ironically, Lamb has <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2018/01/08/nancy-pelosi-paul-ryan-conor-lamb-rick-saccone-18th-district-special-election/stories/201801080095\">called on Pelosi</a> to step down as majority leader, citing the need for new blood.) Likewise, Pelosi’s stand on the floor&#8212;eagerly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PelosiPress/status/961320119212429312\">pushed out by the Democrats’ social-media teams</a>&#8212;quickly became fodder for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArthurSchwartz/status/961306817883238401\">right-wing narrative</a>.</p>\n<p>For Republicans, Pelosi-baiting represents a return to the playbook they used to great effect to demonize Clinton throughout her public life.

Gates argues that Big Tech companies should strike a balance between conducting independent business and allowing for government oversight&#8212;a lesson Gates himself learned when Microsoft attracted a federal inspection over questions of whether it had a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9803/03/gates.full/\">monopoly in the software industry</a>. “Companies need to be careful that they’re not . . . advocating things that would prevent government from being able to, under appropriate review, perform the type of functions that we’ve come to count on,” he said. But the worst is yet to come, says <strong>Aviv Ovadya,</strong> the man who predicted the fake-news crisis of 2016. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-terrifying-future-of-fake-news\">interview</a> with BuzzFeed News, Ovadya predicted that the spread of fake news is likely to accelerate, with better technology that allows for propaganda and misinformation to spread, and digital tools that falsify reality and manipulate perception. With improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, anyone could make it “appear as if anything has happened, regardless of whether or not it did,” Ovadya said. “Previously one would have needed to have a human to mimic a voice or come up with an authentic fake conversation&#8212;in this version you could just press a button using open source software. That’s where it becomes novel&#8212;when anyone can do it because it’s trivial. Then it’s a whole different ball game.”</p>\n<p>As Bilton <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/fake-news-technology/amp\">cautioned</a> last year, however, the momentum in Silicon Valley may be unstoppable. Adobe unveiled its “Photoshop for audio” with fanfare. The film industry has worked to make C.G.I. characters almost indistinguishable from their flesh-and-blood counterparts. As the world becomes increasingly wired and hacking tools more sophisticated, the potential for abuse will correspondingly multiply. In the run-up to the 2016 election, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/25/facebook-russian-meddling-obama-zuckerberg/\">warnings</a> that foreign actors could use social-media platforms to disseminate misinformation went largely ignored within the tech industry itself. This time, should Big Tech fail to heed the red flags that Gates, and others, have raised, we could be in for something even more nightmarish. As Ovadya put it, “We are so screwed it’s beyond what most of us can imagine. . . . And depending how far you look into the future it just gets worse.”</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["bill gates","plague","nick bilton","silicon valley","aviv ovadya"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"The fake-news plague could lead to something much worse.","seoTitle":"Even Bill Gates Is Worried That Silicon Valley Will Unleash the Apocalypse","seoDescription":"The fake-news plague could lead to something much worse.","socialTitle":"Even Bill Gates Is Worried That Silicon Valley Will Unleash the Apocalypse","socialDescription":"The fake-news plague could lead to something much worse.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Big Tech","promoHed":"Even Bill Gates Is Worried That Silicon Valley Will Unleash the Apocalypse","promoDek":"The fake-news plague could lead to something much worse.","id":"5a8302c0bd28cc578e6d8299","revision":4,"createdAt":"February 13, 2018 10:22 am","modifiedAt":"February 13, 2018 10:50 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 13, 2018 10:50 am","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"bill-gates-big-tech-warning.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1333,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/02/13/5a8302edc8ad4a5184fc9a7c_bill-gates-big-tech-warning.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1332,"width":1998,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1998,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":1200,"width":2000,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1200,"width":2000,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1332,"width":888,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":888,"x":556,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1328,"width":747,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1328,"width":747,"x":626.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":855,"width":1995,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":855,"width":1995,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":1125,"width":2000,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1125,"width":2000,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1332,"width":1776,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1332,"width":1776,"x":112,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1333,"width":1333,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1333,"width":1333,"x":333.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"97596738","credit":"By Yana Paskova/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a8302edc8ad4a5184fc9a7d","revision":1,"createdAt":"February 13, 2018 10:23 am","modifiedAt":"February 13, 2018 10:24 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 13, 2018 10:24 am","tags":[],"altText":"97596738","description":"Getty: 850254782","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com.

For critics, this was insufficient: “How do you write a primal scream?” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/01/27/hillary-clinton-metoo-meet-sowhat/?utm_term=.a68c85dba9c4\">asked</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>’s <strong>Ruth Marcus.</strong> So on Tuesday night, with the eyes of the world trained on <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> Clinton published a 1,500-word opus amending her response.</p>\n<p>“I very much understand the question I’m being asked as to why I let an employee on my 2008 campaign keep his job despite his inappropriate workplace behavior,” she <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1811310308925490\">wrote</a>, adding, “The short answer is this: If I had it to do again, I wouldn’t.” She went on to offer a lengthy explanation about why she declined to fire the adviser, <strong>Burns Strider,</strong> citing her attempts to discipline him, her desire to practice forgiveness, and her general aversion to firing people. “At the time, I believed the punishment I imposed was severe and fit the offense. Indeed, while we are revisiting whether my decision from a decade ago was harsh enough, many employers would be well served to take actions at least as severe when confronted with problems now&#8212;including the very media outlet that broke this story,” she added, alluding to <em>The New York Times</em>’ recent decision to reinstate <strong>Glenn Thrush</strong> after he was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/glenn-thrush-investigation-new-york-times\">accused of repeated sexual harassment</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/958559392378564608\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/958559392378564608\">https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/958559392378564608</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Though supporters flooded her comments&#8212;“Why do you even need to defend this when we have a sexual offender in the White House and not a single Republican seems to care?” one <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/posts/1811310308925490?comment_id=1811314192258435&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\">wrote</a>&#8212;the response on the left more closely resembled disappointment. “Her statement falls short as an apology, attempting to deflect attention onto others and failing to address some of the key issues in the case,” <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/30/16953480/hillary-clinton-sexual-harassment-burns-strider\">wrote</a> Vox’s <strong>Anna North,</strong> while longtime supporter <strong>Alyssa Rosenberg</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/01/30/breaking-up-with-hillary-clinton/?utm_term=.f0f1a6cbc586\">declared</a> that she was “done” with Clinton. “I believed that when confronted with allegations of sexual misconduct . . . that she would handle those accusations decisively and in a way that made clear that she was on the side of other women,” wrote Rosenberg, citing Clinton’s history of fighting for women’s rights. But when it came down to it, Rosenberg said, Clinton acted solely in her own self-interest: “I respect Clinton’s personal religious faith and the depth of her belief in forgiveness. What I can’t accept is the idea that forgiving Strider means minimizing the consequences he faced for his behavior, especially when doing so put him in a position to offend again.”</p>\n<p>There was also the issue of timing: Clinton published her post just minutes before Trump took the podium to deliver his lengthy address to Congress. A Clinton aide told <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/clinton-facebook-analysis/index.html\">CNN</a> that the move had not been engineered to deflect press, saying it was “simply when she finished writing it,” but to Clinton foes, it was a prime example of what they perceived as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/958526365745152001\">calculated</a> cold-bloodedness. On a broader level, too, the timing was terrible&#8212;in the throes of the #MeToo movement, a misstep on the issue of sexual harassment cuts deeper than ever before.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of her election loss, Clinton has positioned herself as a Trump antagonist, warning in her first major post-election <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/clinton-targets-trump-in-first-major-post-election-speech.html\">speech</a> last March that the president’s policies would “hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction.” She penned a <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/hillary-clinton-what-happened.html\">ferocious</a> book, toured the country, and inspired certain corners of the Internet to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/hillary-clinton-is-running-for-president-again-214766\">speculate</a> as to her future political ambitions.

Bizarre P.R. Campaign in Philadelphia","body":"<p><strong>Bill Cosby</strong> performed a surprise comedy show Monday night at Lorosa Jazz Club in Philadelphia’s Germantown neighborhood. His representatives alerted journalists two hours before the show, which they called a “comedy concert,” was set to begin. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/23/579884670/bill-cosby-returns-to-stand-up-in-philly-ahead-of-2nd-trial\">NPR’s</a> Philly branch was among those who attended; the station recorded jokes about blindness (his attorneys <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bill-cosby-s-lawyers-say-he-registered-legally-blind-n674246\">have argued</a> that he is legally blind and he has registered with a state commission for the blind) and getting older (he’s 80). Cosby directed the jazz band, even taking over on drums before the bassist’s 11-year-old son took a turn. They chatted in a style reminiscent <em>Kids Say the Darndest Things,</em> asking the boy if he knew who he was. The kid said, “You’re a comedian,” and Cosby responds, “I used to be a comedian.”</p>\n<p>Don’t call it a comeback tour, though. It’s more like strategic schmoozing. Cosby stands accused of drugging and assaulting an acquaintance <strong>Andrea Constand</strong> in his Philadelphia home in 2004, and his criminal retrial is a little over two months away. The show was the latest in what appears to be a play for sympathy among the people of Philadelphia (<em>Vanity Fair</em> has reached out to Cosby’s representation for comment). Earlier in the weekend, Cosby spent time in a barbershop with old friends and fans, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billcosby/status/955091866562846720\">posting videos afterward</a>, and did the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/billcosby/posts/10155643325664930\">same</a> at a local bakery in full Eagles regalia (the Philly team secured their Super Bowl bid on Sunday). Early January, he went to an Italian restaurant in Philly, inviting press and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillCosby/status/951254501209575426\">“loyal supporters”</a> as well.</p>\n<p>The lead-in to his first trial, which <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/06/bill-cosby-mistrial\">ended in a mistrial</a> after the jury was unable to reach a verdict, saw a more reserved Cosby. The comedian largely laid low, having just come off a tour that ended in protest. But on January 19, Judge <strong>Steven O’Neill,</strong> who presided over the first trial, <a href=\"https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/order-commvcosby-cr3932-16.pdf\">set a date</a> to begin a search for the jury for the scheduled retrial on April 2. Cosby’s glad-handing began in earnest after.</p>\n<p>Over 60 women have accused Cosby of drugging and molesting them over the decades. Constand’s case is the only known one that can move through criminal court because it was filed before the statute of limitations (Cosby claims their interaction was consensual, and denies this and all counts of wrongdoing leveled by dozens of women). The prosecutor in the upcoming retrial has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/arts/bill-cosby-accusers.html\">asked the judge</a> to allow 19 other women who allege they were assaulted by Cosby to testify in the new trial.

Because unless it’s addressed it will happen again,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/968321022427652096\">tweeted</a> <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong> “The midterms are in 8 months. We owe it to our democracy to get this right, and fast.” Clinton was responding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kimmaicutler/status/967908818133929985\">a tweet</a> from venture investor <strong>Kim-Mai Cutler,</strong> who wrote that Facebook “may have systematically charged the Clinton campaign an order of magnitude or two more than it was charging Trump to reach American voters.”</p>\n<p>Cutler’s takeaway isn’t quite right: As former Facebook advertising staffer <strong>Antonio García Martínez</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-trump-conquered-facebookwithout-russian-ads/\">explained</a> in <em>Wired,</em> “because Trump used provocative content to stoke social-media buzz, and he was better able to drive likes, comments, and shares than Clinton, his bids received a boost from Facebook’s click model, effectively winning him more media for less money.” In essence, Martínez wrote, “Clinton was paying Manhattan prices for the square footage on your smartphone’s screen, while Trump was paying Detroit prices. Facebook users in swing states who felt Trump had taken over their news feeds may not have been hallucinating.” Former Trump campaign digital director <strong>Brad Parscale’s</strong> efforts were so successful that the president has reportedly tapped him to manage his 2020 re-election campaign, signaling that Team Trump will continue to rely on its digital dominance in the upcoming election cycle.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, however, Facebook did something unusual for the traditionally secretive social-media giant: it published, via Vice President of Consumer Hardware <strong>Andrew Bosworth,</strong> a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boztank/status/968577962223136768\">chart</a> purporting to show that the Trump campaign actually paid slightly higher CPM prices than Clinton did. “After some discussion we&#39;ve decided to share the CPM comparison on Trump campaign ads vs. Clinton campaign ads,” Bosworth tweeted, perhaps in response to the attention Clinton had brought to the issue. “Given the recent discussion about pricing we&#39;re putting this out to clear up any confusion.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/boztank/status/968577962223136768\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/boztank/status/968577962223136768\">https://twitter.com/boztank/status/968577962223136768</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Facebook’s unexpected rebuttal only prompted more confusion online, where Bosworth’s tweets were met with skepticism. The cost as presented in his chart only counts paid reach, and not myriad other factors&#8212;things like audience size, and who a campaign targets&#8212;that affect how much a client would pay for advertising. <em>Wired</em> summarizes some of the lingering questions in its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-trump-clinton-campaign-ad-cpms/\">response</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While this chart does show that the Trump campaign paid higher rates overall than the Clinton campaign did&#8212;and that how competitive the ad market gets as the election approaches&#8212;it doesn&#39;t tell the full story. Much of the public outcry centered around the idea that Facebook’s system prioritizes more provocative or outrageous political ads. That, in turn, has stoked fears about whether Facebook’s ad algorithms reward mudslinging and fear-mongering. The chart Bosworth shared sheds no light on this question, because it contains no information about the content of the ads on any given day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s also unclear which types of messages and targeting correspond with what pricing. An ad targeted at a custom list of voters will have a higher CPM than one with a national audience, for instance. The chart does not show what the Clinton and Trump campaigns would have paid for an apples-to-apples ad buy. In fact, that may ultimately be impossible to tell, given how many variations are at play in terms of who the campaigns are trying to reach, where they&#39;re trying to reach them, and what they&#39;re trying to get out of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if Trump paid slightly more for ads, the data from Facebook <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahfrier/status/968589931172868096\">seems not to</a> account for organic reach. So, depending on how users reacted to either campaign’s ads, they could have spread further, been seen by more people, and gotten cheaper the more effective the messages became. It’s never been much of a secret that Facebook advertising works like this: the more that people engage with an ad on Facebook, the less Facebook charges those advertisers to reach an audience. As with Google’s AdSense auction product, Facebook’s advertising system is built to reward virality.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/968608340132548609\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/968608340132548609\">https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/968608340132548609</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Bosworth’s tweet puts Facebook at odds with claims by both Parscale and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmpalmieri/status/967944615801188352\">Clinton’s team</a>, which found themselves in the rare position of agreeing with each other, this weekend, about the fact that Trump’s campaign had been more digitally savvy. (“This is why @realDonaldTrump was a perfect candidate for FaceBook,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/967516077956755457\">tweeted</a> Parscale. “Agreed,” responded <strong>Jennifer Palmieri‏,</strong> Clinton’s former campaign communications director.) It appears that Facebook’s claim is at odds with those of its former employee and officials from two opposing political campaigns. But it’s impossible to gauge the true effectiveness of the ad spends of each campaign without more information. (An immediate question: How did the campaigns fare, CPM-wise, in truly similar ad purchases, like ones in the same county, with the same type of creative assets and intended audiences?) That would be convenient for Facebook, which maintains that its platform is perfectly neutral, at least to the extent that all of its advertisers are offered equal opportunities to maximize their reach. “The auction system works the same for everybody,” <strong>Andy Stone,</strong> a Facebook spokesperson, told <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/why-donald-trump-was-the-perfect-candidate-for-facebook/554294/\"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>. “It affords equality of opportunity.” (Citing previously announced initiatives, Bosworth said the company hopes to be more transparent about its ad products in the near future.)</p>\n<p>It is, in other words, precisely the sort of controversy that Facebook is hoping to tamp down as it pivots away from news, promises greater transparency about political ads, and refocuses its efforts on fostering more personal connections between family and friends online. Bosworth’s unusual decision to weigh in on a Twitter debate, then, may have been an effort to kill one story (Trump paid Facebook less) without accidentally sparking new storylines by offering up enough data to satisfy his critics. More important, it underscores how fiercely Facebook will protect its advertising product, which remains the profit engine of the company. “In large part it’s the advertising and product-management teams that really define the product more than anyone else,” <strong>Dipayan Ghosh,</strong> a former Facebook executive who helped oversee the company’s public positions on privacy and telecommunications, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/can-facebook-go-cold-turkey\">noted</a> last month. “At the end of the day, it’s a for-profit company, and doesn’t want to cannibalize its own revenue streams.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/577ffc4018df9c24d400000d.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["facebook","hillary clinton","donald trump","campaign"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Facebook says Trump paid more than Clinton for ads in the 2016 election cycle.

(Through a representative, Weinstein responded to Thurman’s allegations of assault in the <em>Times</em>&#8212;one in Paris and one in England&#8212;by saying, “Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals in Paris,” the statement said. “He immediately apologized.”) While the actress praised director <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>&#8212;whom she said urged her to drive the car herself despite her misgivings&#8212;for giving her the footage despite the damage it could cause him, she did not have any such sentiments for the people she charges with the subsequent “cover up,” including Weinstein.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block social-instagram row\"><blockquote class=\"embed instagram-embed-component instagram-media \" data-instgrm-captioned=\"true\" data-instgrm-version=\"2\" data-type=\"instagram\" data-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Be0x6OCFRwQ/\"><div class=\"instagram-media-container\"><div class=\"instagram-media-wrapper\"><div class=\"instagram-media-inner\"><div class=\"instagram-media-view\"></div><span class=\"instagram-media-loading\">Loading</span></div></div><p class=\"instagram-media-more\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Be0x6OCFRwQ/\" target=\"blank\">View on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p><em>The New York Times</em> posted video of the crash along with its interview; on Monday, Thurman posted a portion of the clip to her Instagram page in order to “memorialize it’s full exposure in the nyt by <strong>Maureen Dowd.</strong>” The actress called the circumstances surrounding the accident “negligent to the point of criminality.” According to the <em>Times,</em> Thurman had asked a stunt person to drive the convertible for an iconic <em>Kill Bill</em> scene, after she heard from a teamster that the vehicle might not be performing properly. Tarantino pushed her to drive it herself anyway, and as seen in the footage, Thurman hit a palm tree in the process. Her head slumps backward in the clip; eventually, she is lifted out of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>Thurman writes on Instagram, however, that she does not believe there was “malicious intent” on Tarantino’s part before the crash. A legal representative for Tarantino did not immediately respond to <em>V.F.</em>’s request for comment.</p>\n<p>“Quentin Tarantino, was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so i could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible,” Thurman wrote. “He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and i am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage.”</p>\n<p>As Thurman told the <em>Times,</em> at the time of the accident, “The steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me. I felt this searing pain and thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m never going to walk again.’” After the crash, Thurman and Tarantino had a falling out&#8212;but 15 years later, the director gave her the footage. Still, Thurman does not appear to be ready to make amends with producers on the film; as she wrote on Instagram, “THE COVER UP after the fact is UNFORGIVABLE.”</p>\n<p>It’s perhaps worth noting that this scene in <em>Kill Bill</em> has appeared on Thurman’s Instagram at least once before&#8212;on Thanksgiving, after Thurman had already <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrWG6UmqkBw\">responded</a> to a question about the #MeToo movement and the Weinstein allegations by saying,“I’ve been waiting to feel less angry, and when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.” Back then, Thurman wrote on Instagram, “I am grateful today, to be alive, for all those I love, and for all those who have the courage to stand up for others. I said I was angry recently, and I have a few reasons, #metoo, in case you couldn’t tell by the look on my face. I feel it’s important to take your time, be fair, be exact, so... Happy Thanksgiving Everyone! (Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators - I’m glad it’s going slowly - you don’t deserve a bullet) -stay tuned.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block social-instagram row\"><blockquote class=\"embed instagram-embed-component instagram-media \" data-instgrm-captioned=\"true\" data-instgrm-version=\"2\" data-type=\"instagram\" data-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb2h0hBlV3T/\"><div class=\"instagram-media-container\"><div class=\"instagram-media-wrapper\"><div class=\"instagram-media-inner\"><div class=\"instagram-media-view\"></div><span class=\"instagram-media-loading\">Loading</span></div></div><p class=\"instagram-media-more\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb2h0hBlV3T/\" target=\"blank\">View on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>It was difficult for Thurman to work after the accident, the actress told the <em>Times</em>: “I went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool. . . . What really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?”</p>\n<p>Agents for producers <strong>Lawrence Bender</strong> and <strong>E.

She clearly has enough money that she doesn’t need to work for the rest of her life.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a625ac7148bb001d9000020.js?autoplay=0\"></div></div><p>Fresh off a weeklong trip that sent her to North Dakota and Minneapolis for case work, and then on to Miami to speak at the National Trial Lawyers Conference&#8212;before hitting New York for film promotional duties&#8212;Allred sits high atop the center of Los Angeles in her 15th-floor office for an interview.</p>\n<p>She is surrounded by reminders of what’s at stake.</p>\n<p>In one corner of the room sits an English Bobby Police uniform from the 1920s, adorned with a pair of handcuffs conspicuously placed on the belt loop. Allred tells me she bought the handcuffs in England years ago to remind her&#8212;and really, anyone who walks into her office&#8212;that these were the very shackles used by the police to take suffragettes to jail when they were out in the street protesting for their right to vote.</p>\n<p>Across the room sits a tattered copy of Midge Mackenzie’s book <em>Shoulder to Shoulder,</em> which chronicles the suffragette movement, and was later turned into a BBC miniseries. Allred said she met Mackenzie back in the 1970s, soon after she started practicing law, and the author inspired Allred to pursue her life’s work. Next to the book is a large photograph of Allred and <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> a daily reminder of how close she came to witnessing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/the-great-white-irony-of-clintons-stunning-loss\">first elected female president</a>, and how much more work needs to be done.</p>\n<p>“I still believe we will have a woman president,” she said. “I think she’ll be a feminist woman president, and I hope I’m alive to see it. But If I’m not, [I know] we’re still on the path.”</p>\n<p>Allred constantly peppers her speech with witticisms from the movement, thoughts that aren’t just catchy sayings but inspirations that seem to resonate with her deeply.</p>\n<p>When she starts talking about the common woman, she backs away, saying how much she dislikes the term common. Then immediately she ushers in a quote: “The common woman is as common as the common loaf of bread and she shall rise.” Or when asked about the disappointment of the presidential election, she touts: “They can break our hearts, but they can’t break our spirit.”</p>\n<p>Moments of introspection from Allred aren’t hard to come by, whether it’s from asking for her reaction to the film (“I hope it will inspire women around the world to say, ‘I can speak out. I don’t have to suffer in silence. I don’t have to live in fear’”) or how it feels when she is criticized, as she has often been during her lengthy career.</p>\n<p>“I have perspective. I know what the suffragettes went through, which is far worse than any attacks I have ever been the target of,” she said. “Also, my perspective is that those who name-call don’t have a good argument against what I’m advocating. If there’s name-calling, [saying] four-letter words, or discussing women’s genitals, to me they might as well just haul up the white flag of surrender.”</p>\n<p>Documentary filmmakers <strong>Sophie Sartain</strong> and Grossman spent two years trying to gain Allred’s trust and earn access into her life. “She’s got an incredible life story. It’s dramatic and compelling, and she’s been involved in these high-profile cases for four decades. Once we read her book, it was a no-brainer that somebody had to make a film about this woman,” said Sartain. “At first she was reluctant. Even though she’s in the public eye a lot, she’s a private person. Any time you embark on an endeavor like that, you have to open yourself up in a way, and that’s a little daunting.”</p>\n<p>Allred finally succumbed to the duo’s persistence in 2014 and the women spent three years following Allred around, capturing her work fighting such alleged predators as <strong>Bill Cosby, Donald Trump,</strong> and, most recently, <strong>Harvey Weinstein.</strong></p>\n<p>Allred wanted the documentary to focus more on her clients, specifically the women she believes have transformed from powerless victims to strong survivors, often united by the opportunity to tell their stories. The documentarians, of course, wanted to uncover what drives Allred.</p>\n<p>She compromised. The directors could have a little of her: glimpses of her beachfront home in Malibu, insight into her past, a few details on her two ex-husbands. In exchange, they would highlight the women she defends and illustrate their transformation. “These women, the alleged victims, these are the voices that need to be heard,” said Allred. “I want to inspire and empower others. I want people to know you don’t have to be a lawyer to help win change. That’s what it’s all about.”</p>\n<p>In between the dramatic moments with her clients, viewers of the film get to witness Allred trudging alone through airports and dragging her case files through hotel lobbies&#8212;intimate moments that illustrate her commitment to the cause. In one powerful scene, the filmmakers ask Allred about her second husband, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-20/news/mn-14752_1_gloria-allred\">William Allred</a>, who was accused of defrauding the government in 1987. She sits quietly and refuses to give an answer.</p>\n<p>“It might be a little hard for me to watch myself not wanting to say something, but I still don’t want to say anything, so nothing’s changed,” she said, before breaking into her signature smile. “I wouldn’t have done anything differently.”</p>\n<p>Added Grossman, “It’s not hidden in the film that she’s reluctant to talk about herself on the personal level. . . . We tried mightily. She allowed us to be intimate in her life by just being present. But she’s very media savvy. There wasn’t another way we could ask the question that was going to surprise her or make her tell us something.”</p>\n<p>Today, Allred is even busier than usual. Fighting for women’s rights long before the #MeToo movement, Allred and her law firm are getting more e-mails than ever. And she sees the culture changing. “I think there’s been an enormous power shift,” she said. “Now, many victims who have been on the defensive are on the offensive, and many of the accused who have been on the offensive are now on the defensive, waking up every morning, thinking, ‘Oh, am I next?’”</p>\n<p>Grossman also sees the culture changing for Allred. “This film comes out at a moment when the zeitgeist has changed,” she said. “And it could be argued that Gloria had a big role in reaching this tipping point. Women are being listened to and believed. But Gloria is also being listened to and believed.”</p>\n<p>None of that seems to matter to Allred. In the past few weeks, she’s been attending a slew of screenings of her film and during the Q&amp;As that follow, she likes to end the conversation with her favorite quote, a line from labor activist Mother Jones meant to be more about action than inspiration: “Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living,” she recites.</p>\n<p>“That’s what I’m going to continue to do.”</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","tags":["gloria allred","netflix","documentary","harvey weinstein","donald trump"],"ledeCaption":"Attorney Gloria Allred is the subject of

candidate, a longtime champion of women and women’s rights, found herself semi-apologizing for her own #MeToo scandal. “A story appeared today about something that happened in 2008,” Clinton tweeted late Friday night, hours after <em>The New York Times</em> published a story about how Clinton had allegedly protected a top adviser who had been accused by a female staffer of sexual harassment. “I was dismayed when it occurred, but was heartened the young woman came forward, was heard, and had her concerns taken seriously and addressed. I called her today to tell her how proud I am of her and to make sure she knows what all women should: we deserve to be heard.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t quite the mea culpa some critics were looking for, given the details of the report. According to the <em>Times,</em> other members of Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign staff had urged her to fire <strong>Burns Strider,</strong> her faith adviser, after a younger staffer who shared an office with Strider accused him of harassment. Instead, Clinton made the decision to move the woman, and kept Strider on staff, though he was docked several weeks of pay and was sent to sexual harassment training.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/957091288754606080\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/957091288754606080\">https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/957091288754606080</a></p></blockquote></div><p>As <em>The Washington Post</em>’s <strong>Ruth Marcus</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/01/27/hillary-clinton-metoo-meet-sowhat/?utm_term=.8bbafa2120e5\">wrote</a>, “#MeToo, meet #SoWhat.”</p>\n<p>Strider had been accused of touching the female staffer inappropriately, sending her suggestive e-mails, and kissing her forehead.

(Cast member <strong>Mikey Day</strong> was under that cloak, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeyfuntime/status/901137306530263043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2017%2F08%2Fsnl-grim-reaper-mikey-day-steve-bannon-saturday-night-live-1202156581%2F\">tweeted a farewell</a> to the mask after Bannon was fired last August.)</p>\n<p>But now that Bannon isn’t just out of the White House but <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/breitbart-post-bannon-landscape\">deeply on the outs</a> with the people who made him famous, <em>Saturday Night Live</em>’s writers aren’t likely to bring him back into the action any time soon. So they gave him a farewell honor, of sorts, by finally removing the grim reaper mask to reveal . . . <strong>Bill Murray</strong>??</p>\n<p>Outfitted in a “wrinkled barn jacket,” some lovingly applied facial splotches, and a truly luxurious wig, Murray popped up near the end of a <em>Morning Joe</em> sketch, sitting next to <strong>Michael Wolff</strong> (<strong>Fred Armisen</strong> in an eerily dead-on impression) to refute some of the claims made in Wolff’s new book <em>Fire and Fury.</em> “No one gets the Bannon fired,” Murray’s Bannon claimed. “I never said Don Jr. was treasonous.”</p>\n<p>“Yes you did,” Armisen’s Wolff responded.</p>\n<p>“Well, I certainly never said he cracked like an egg on TV.”</p>\n<p>“Yes you did, that sounds exactly like you.”</p>\n<p>“O.K. that does sound like me,” Murray’s Bannon concluded. “Thank you, good reporting.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1\">https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/952402779062067200/video/1</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Bannon went on to detail all of his post-Breitbart plans, including a Crackle series called (<em>Cucks in Cars Getting Coffee,</em> a menswear line called Frumpers, and a skincare line called Blotch. He also claimed to be hard at work finding the next Trump-like unlikely political leader. “Logan Paul. Martin Shkreli. Jared the Subway guy. It’s time for America to slide down the Bannonster.” On that last line, Murray&#8212;a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> veteran famous for his deadpan&#8212;couldn’t resist cracking up.</p>\n<p>At this point nearly all of the most famous impressions of Trump administration members belong to superstars who aren’t in the regular <em>S.N.L.</em> cast&#8212; <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> set the template as Trump (an impression no one thought would last beyond the election), then <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong> ushered in the show’s period of hyper-relevance as <strong>Sean Spicer,</strong> the Emmy-winning impression that likely inadvertently sparked Spicer’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/colbert-emmys-sean-spicer-skit\">pop-culture comeback</a>. It seems likely that Murray only took the Bannon job, though, knowing that it would be a onetime thing. And it was a far more political appearance for Murray than the last time he returned to 30 Rock, showing up in October 2016 to celebrate the World Series victory of his beloved Chicago Cubs. But a lot has changed since the fall of 2016, after all. And when there’s a former White House employee best captured by a grim reaper mask, who better to send him off in splotchy style than Murray?</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["saturday night live","snl","bill murray","steve bannon"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"So <em>that’s</em> who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","seoTitle":"Saturday Night Live Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","seoDescription":"So that’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","socialTitle":"Saturday Night Live Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","socialDescription":"So that’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Live From New York","promoHed":"<em>Saturday Night Live</em> Reveals Bill Murray as Their Steve Bannon","promoDek":"So <em>that</em>’s who was under that grim reaper mask all along.","id":"5a5ae12b057a2c6758d78070","revision":15,"createdAt":"January 13, 2018 11:48 pm","modifiedAt":"January 16, 2018 12:08 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 16, 2018 12:08 pm","_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Katherine Rich","filename":"bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":690,"height":460,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2018/01/14/5a5ae2aa0ba3dc230ebe7670_bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":460,"width":690,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":460,"width":690,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":414,"width":690,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":414,"width":690,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":459,"width":306,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":459,"width":306,"x":192,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":448,"width":252,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":448,"width":252,"x":219,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":294,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":294,"width":686,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":387,"width":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":387,"width":688,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":459,"width":612,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":459,"width":612,"x":39,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":460,"width":460,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":460,"width":460,"x":115,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"bill-murray-steve-bannon-snl.jpg","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"5a5ae2aa0ba3dc230ebe7671","revision":0,"createdAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","modifiedAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 13, 2018 11:55 pm","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Katey Rich is the deputy editor of VanityFair.com.

In an Instagram post, she wrote that her “heart goes out to Uma,” but that her experience with Tarantino was “pure joy.”</p>\n<p>“He treated me with utter respect and never abused his power or forced me to do anything I wasn’t comfortable with,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>The original post continues below:</em></p>\n<p><strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> is speaking up. In a wide-ranging interview with <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-uma-thurman-harvey-weinstein-kill-bill-car-crash-new-york-times-1202278988/\">Deadline</a>, the director candidly discussed his relationship with <strong>Uma Thurman,</strong> directly addressing the claims she made <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/uma-thurman-harvey-weinstein-attack\">in a recent interview</a> with <em>The New York Times.</em></p>\n<p>Though he and Thurman are now cordial to one another, Tarantino admitted that there were a few rocky years after her terrifying car accident on the set of <em>Kill Bill.</em> He explained his decision to spit on her and choke her for scenes in <em>Kill Bill</em>&#8212;revelations that were met with backlash on social media, painting Tarantino as a sadistic auteur who liked to personally torture his leading ladies. And Tarantino also spoke about his shock and ultimate “complacency” after finding out <strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong> had sexually harassed both Thurman and actress <strong>Mira Sorvino,</strong> who was Tarantino’s girlfriend at the time.</p>\n<p>Tarantino began by going into detail about the <em>Kill Bill</em> car accident. “It’s the biggest regret of my life, getting her to do that stunt,” he said.</p>\n<p>In her interview, Thurman described a simple car stunt she had to perform for the film: driving a convertible down a straight piece of road at about 40 miles per hour. Thurman wanted to have a stunt person drive the car because, she said, a teamster had told her that the car might not be working properly. By her account, Tarantino was furious with her request and ultimately persuaded her to do the stunt. Thurman ended up losing control of the car and crashing, injuring her neck and knees. She was not able to acquire footage of the accident until recently, after Tarantino and producer <strong>Shannon McIntosh</strong> hunted it down and shared it with her; Thurman primarily <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/uma-thurman-crash-footage-kill-bill-instagram\">blamed Weinstein and producers</a> for allegedly covering up her accident for so long. The producers have not responded to her allegations.</p>\n<p>“I can’t tell you . . . it was literally my happiest day this year, when Shannon found that footage and sent it over to me and I knew I was going to be able to present it to Uma,” Tarantino told Deadline. He defended himself against characterizations that he was furious with her then for not doing the stunt, saying that he performed the stunt himself to make sure it was safe.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, seeing her crash “was heartbreaking,” Tarantino added. “Beyond one of the biggest regrets of my career, it is one of the biggest regrets of my life . . . It affected me and Uma for the next two to three years. It wasn’t like we didn’t talk. But a trust was broken.”</p>\n<p>Tarantino was, however, slightly indignant about the uproar that erupted over him spitting on Thurman during filming. “What’s the fucking problem?” he asked. When it was clarified that the action seemed disrespectful, the director explained that he wasn’t sure actor <strong>Michael Madsen,</strong> who was supposed to do the spitting, would be able to get it right on the first take: “I didn’t trust him with this kind of intricate work.”</p>\n<p>He added that he explained his choice to Thurman, and received her permission to do it two or three times. As for the choking scene, he said that was “Uma’s suggestion” for Tarantino to do it himself, in order to make it look realistic. He later did the same thing to <strong>Diane Kruger</strong> while filming <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> after the <em>Kill Bill</em> experience, Tarantino said.</p>\n<p>“She agreed with it, she knew it would look good and she trusted me to do it,” he said. “I would ask a guy the same thing. In fact, I would probably be more insistent with a guy.”</p>\n<p>Tarantino also revealed that Thurman told him about Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment, which led the director to confront the producer and insist that he apologize. “I knew he was lying, that everything Uma was saying, was the truth,” he told Deadline. “When he tried to wriggle out of it, and how things actually happened, I never bought his story.” (Weinstein has released <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2018/02/harvey-weinstein-response-uma-thurman-photos-1202277657/\">a thorough statement</a> denying Thurman’s allegations.)</p>\n<p>Tarantino also remembered being “shocked and appalled” when Sorvino told him of her alleged encounter with Weinstein. (Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual acts.) Back in October, he was one of the first filmmakers to admit that he was well aware of allegations against Weinstein for years, telling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> that he “knew enough to do more than [he] did” and heard “more than just the normal rumors.” In his interview with Deadline, he explained his line of thinking a bit more.</p>\n<p>“For some reason that now feels wrong, back in 1999, it was easier to chalk up what he was doing to this mid-60s, <em>Mad Men,</em> <em>Bewitched</em> era of an executive chasing the secretary around the desk,” the director said. “Now, it’s like . . . as if that was ever O.K.! One of the things that has happened in this whole thing is there is a lot of staring in the mirror. And thinking about, how did you think about things during that time? What did you do in that time? What was your feeling about things at that time?”</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","tags":["quentin tarantino","uma thurman","kill bill","Harvey Weinstein","_sensitivecontent","sexual
